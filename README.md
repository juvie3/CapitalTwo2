## Intro

Thank you for taking the time to check out my website. For this application, I wanted to challenge myself by dealing with a more complex database structure. So, I decided to clone my personal bank: Capital One. Banks can seem simple to use by a user, but there is so much going on in the background. Actually, keeping the UX seamless and effortless was one of my primary goals. I did take liberties in changing how the original site looked and felt in an effort to achieve that goal. And, as you can see, the UI is extremely clean and simple, which makes the website look and feel beautiful. Please enjoy!
