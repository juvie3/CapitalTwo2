This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will need to run `npm install` to install all your dependencies before starting up the application. You can run this application from this location using `npm start`.

No environment variables are needed to run this application locally, but be sure to set the REACT_APP_BASE_URL environment variable if you deploy!
